    "# Predicting <sup>13</sup>C NMR shifts of organic molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict <sup>13</sup>C NMR chemical shifts in organic molecules. To each carbon atom in a molecule corresponds a chemical shift, which is linked to the local magnetic field experienced by that nucleus, and is therefore linked to the chemical environment: neighboring atoms, type of bonds, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use data from the [nmrshiftdb2 project](https://nmrshiftdb.nmr.uni-koeln.de/nmrshiftdb/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/portal/js_pane/P-Help;jsessionid=B237E9AB49EB45D0F9E560719C792E4A?URL=t1.html#about), an open database for organic structures and their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has taken inspiration from various sources:\n",
    "- The preprint [“NMR shift prediction from small data quantities”](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.03361), on arXiv.\n",
    "- The [associated python code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yKTRjpWzR8T199eCokuJfd9Y5o2oNtPp#scrollTo=wha6jaKTZlUX)\n",

    "We see that the 2D molecular structure is present, as well as some metadata associated with the NMR information. That data is in a series of fields, prefixed with `NMREDATA_`, in a format that is not immediately obvious. It is documented in this associated paper: [“NMReDATA, a standard to report the NMR assignment and parameters of organic compounds”](https://hal.science/hal-01904910/), which I encourage you to read. Some fields are easy:\n",
    "- `NMREDATA_ID` relates to the identifier of this molecule in the database\n",
    "- `NMREDATA_SMILES` and `NMREDATA_INCHI` are two representations of the identity of the molecule\n",
    "- `NMREDATA_SOLVENT` is the solvent used for the measurement\n",
    "- `NMREDATA_1D_13C` contains a <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum, with what seems to be values of chemical shifts\n",
    "- `NMREDATA_ASSIGNMENT` has a list of signals, chemical shifts, and corresponding atom number (the assignment of the signals in the spectrum to individual atoms)\n",

    "## Identifying descriptors of chemical environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a list of chemical shifts, as well as corresponding atoms and the molecules they belong to. In order to train a predictor for the chemical shifts, we now need to encode the chemical information into a series of features, or descriptors. When we predict molecular properties (like solubility, melting point, etc) we naturally use molecular descriptors (molecular weight, number of aromatic rings, etc). In this case, our task is different: we want to predict properties of specific atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the descriptors we will create will not be descriptor of the whole molecule, but descriptors of the atom and its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "That makes sense from the chemical point of view as well: we know that the chemical shift is heavily influenced by the electronic density and the chemical environment, so while creating our list of descriptors, we will have to consider things like:\n",
    "- what atoms is the C atom bonded to?\n",
    "- what type of bonds (single, double)?\n",
    "- is it in an aromatic ring?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we create for each carbon a series of chemical descriptors of its environment."

    "OK, why are there extremely large coefficients in the linear regression? Because the descriptors are strongly correlated, and this means that the coefficients of the regression become ill-defined. You can read more there: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/24452\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid regression coefficients becoming very large, the standard technique is called [regularization](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/python_scripts/linear_models_regularization.html). We will use here a variant of linear regression called [Ridge regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ridge-regression-and-classification), which imposes a penalty on the size of the coefficients. We won't look too much into the details at this point, in particular, we will use a single value of the alpha coefficient for regularization (instead of tuning it)."

    "- The effet of solvent is know to be very important, but we have discarded it completely here. How can you take it into account? Does it help in obtaining better statistical accuracy for the predictor?\n",
    "- What is the impact of the quantity of available data? This is an very important concept called “data efficiency”: how much does the accuracy of the trained model depend on the amount of data it was trained on? This is important to investigate, especially if you want to make predictors for isotopes that have less data than <sup>13</sup>C.\n",
    "- Nature of the model: we have only tested above a simple linear regression model (with regularization). How do other types of model perform for the same task, trained with the same data? Be careful to avoid overfitting, though!\n",
    "- Here we have only considered some properties of nearest neighbors, i.e., the atoms directly bonded to the C center. How can we take into account further neighbors? It is possible to use hand-made descriptors (as above), or to rely on atom-based fingerprints. [Morgan fingerprints](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#morgan-fingerprints-circular-fingerprints), for example, can be calculated in RDkit with a given radius (number of neighbors taken into account) and centered on a specific atom (with the `fromAtoms` argument to the `GetFingerprint` function).\n",
    "- Instead of looking at the physical properties of neighboring atoms, another approach is called the family of [group contribution methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group-contribution_method). In these, you try to recognize groups of atoms bonded to the central atom, through patterns, and fit their potential “contributions”. It is also a statistical learning approach, but it will use as descriptors an encoding of the groups present or not. Can it provide a better accuracy than our model above?"
